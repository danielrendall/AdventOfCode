# Advent of Code

These are my solutions (with my data) for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
challenge. I was only introduced to it in 2021, but I might tackle the
challenges for previous years at some point. I chose Scala 3 to get some
experience with it, since all of my work projects are currently Scala 2.

# Disclaimer

I don't claim these are the best solutions, or the best code, or anything. If
you're doing the challenge yourself, I would suggest not exploring this repo
any further.
